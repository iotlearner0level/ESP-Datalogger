#Datalogger using ArduinoJSON and SPIFFS

It should be able to store data in the SPIFFS storage as well as push it to the cloud services. 

Further, we are also interested in downloading the file from the SPIFFS storage of the ESP8266 and if possible from the SDCARD. 

This data should be modifiable from the webserver itself. 

We should be able to adjust the parameters, add cloud services url, username and password after the code is run.
